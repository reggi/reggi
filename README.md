## I'm Thomas 👋

I'm a software engineer living in Astoria Queens, NY. I’m a naturally curious person. I love to find out how things work. I love to hack on new projects, and reverse engineer existing ones. I passionate about learning and understanding more about my surroundings and myself.  To me, programming is an art form, it’s a means of creative expression as well as communication. If you feel the same I'd love to meetup and grab coffee ☕️ (or tea 🍵).
