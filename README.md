Hey I'm Tea ✌️

I first learned HTML in high school and used my skills to create AOL Hometown websites and customize my MySpace page. I continued to teach myself programming in my spare time while studying Graphic Design at the College of Staten Island (CUNY). I have worked at several companies, including small startups and Fortune 500 companies, and I've been working as a professional coder for over 12 years.

I grew up in Brooklyn and currently live in Queens. In my free time, I enjoy making things with my hands and tinkering with physical stuff. I sew machine and enjoy making and repairing clothing, as well as cosplay costumes. I also enjoy browsing thrift stores for treasures to upcycle. I enjoy practicing hot yoga, reading, and exploring the world of espresso and hole-in-the-wall coffee shops. I am interested in mysticism and spirituality, especially Zen and Tibetan Buddhism. I am interested in the no-code and low-code movements and hope to see a future where it is easier for people to learn how to code and make apps. I am always open to networking and meeting new people, whether it be in person over a cup of coffee or tea, or virtually over video or phone call.
